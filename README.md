Abstract:
There are two main approaches to enterprise marketing: (1) mass campaigns, targeting several general customers, or (2) directed marketing, targeting a specific set of customers. In this competitive world, the mass campaign strategy is not very productive. Nevertheless, there are challenges to directed marketing: finding potential customers is not very easy, although data mining (DM) techniques are providing some assistance in that regard. The given dataset is from a Portuguese banking institution and was used in their direct marketing campaign to sell term deposits to their customers. You can think of it as cross-selling. The campaign was mostly based on phone calls and the dataset stores general information about customers, details of contacts made with them and the output variable y which indicates whether a term deposit was subscribed to by the customer or not. There are two datasets –

Portuguese Bank Data – TRAIN
Portuguese Bank Data - TEST

Predict whether a Bank customer will do a Term Deposit with Portuguese Bank using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers
We apply Hyper Parameters Tuning to find the best parameters for Decision Tree and Random Forest Models

To handle categorical data, we apply the technique of OneHotEncoding.
